; Standing strong punch
; CNS difficulty: easy
; Note the width controller. It makes KFM's push box larger, so he doesn't

; The sprpriority for this state is at -1, instead of the usual 2 for
; attacks. This makes KFM appear behind the opponent initially.
; The SprPriority controller in [State 210, 4] brings KFM to the front when
; his arm has swung over.
; To stop KFM from pausing in his swing frame, there is a ChangeAnim in
; [State 210, 3] that detects if the hit has come in contact with the
; opponent during that frame, and switches to the next animation element
; (notice the elem=6 parameter). If you don't see what I mean, try commenting
; out that controller, then hit someone with this attack.

; Crouching Light Punch
; CNS difficulty: easy
; Description: Simple crouching attack. The HitDef's guardflag parameter
;     is set to "L", meaning that the move can only be guarded low
;     (crouching), and not by standing or jumping opponents.
;     Like for all light attacks, it's a good idea to keep the slidetime
;     and hittime parameters at a smaller number, so the opponent isn't
;     stunned for too long. For all crouching attacks you have to
;     remember to set the attr parameter to indicate that it is crouching
;     attack. In this case, "C, NA" stands for "crouching, normal attack".
;     The HitDef's priority is set at 3, instead of the default of 4,
;     so this attack has a lower priority than most others, meaning the
;     player will get hit instead of trading hits with the opponent if
;     their attack collision boxes (Clsn1) intersect each other's Clsn2
;     boxes at the same time.
